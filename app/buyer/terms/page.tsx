            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Informal Negotiations</h3>
            <p>
              To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal
              Terms (each a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a
              “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute
              (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 90 days before initiating
              arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Binding Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
              Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Legal Terms, including any question regarding its
              existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by an arbitrator agreed to
              by both parties.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Restrictions</h3>
            <p>
              The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.
              To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
              there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize
              class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
              purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
              The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal
              negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
              validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising
              from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
              injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will
              elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
              unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts
              listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
